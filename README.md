Word Counting Game in Python by Medhnaa Saran!
This unique game challenges players to guess a word from a predefined word. Whether you choose to guess the entire word or individual letters, the game keeps you on your toes. However, be warned, there are limited attempts, adding an element of suspense and strategy to the game.
- I have added a bar graph to make the game more visually appealing!
- Good luck playing!

How to play:
- Players will input a letter or a phrase
- The code will tell them if the input is "correct" or "incorrect."
- Players will have three attempts to choose the correct sport!
