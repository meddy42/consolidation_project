Word Counting Game in Python by Medhnaa Saran!
- The purpose of this game is to guess the word from a predefined wordbank. Players can wither guess the whole word at once or guess individual letters. However, despite feedback there are limited attempts on how many chances the player recieves.
- To make the game more visually appealing, I have added a bar graph!
- Good luck playing!
